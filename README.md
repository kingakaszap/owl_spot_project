# Finding the spots in owls
A repo for the final project for Machine Learning for Earth and Environmental Sciences at UNIL, in the autumn semester of 2025. The project is about training a U-net sytle CNN to find the spots on owl plumages with semantic segmentation :) 

The final model did quite a good job atsegmenting the spots!

The raw data used for the project can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YlliTUpWy_NxhM_7obUm_R0W0u-Jb-cV/view?usp=sharing). 

The code is available on this repo as a .py file [here](https://github.com/kingakaszap/owl_spot_project/blob/main/find_spots_owls.py), but also on Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yUj3QwHy5vIr7knU2W3HkS3nmfoS56Uy?usp=sharing). (unfortunately I had issues with uploading it here directly from colab, likely due to the large file size with lots of inline images and saved otputs). 

The final project report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/kingakaszap/owl_spot_project/blob/main/ml_owls%20(1).pdf).
