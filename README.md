# owl_spot_project
A repo for the final project for Machine Learning for Earth and Environmental Sciences at UNIL, in the autumn semester of 2025. The project is about training a U-net sytle CNN to find the spots on owl plumages :) 

The raw data used for the project can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/139dMt0Wu3XydoMMGFgCavwK0fzlfcaQJ?usp=drive_link).
